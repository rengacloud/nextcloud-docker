**Describe the format you'd like to have added**
What is it good for, where is it used, is there an alternative (e.g. export in another format)?

**This plugin is based on three.js, so there has to be some kind of plugin for three.js for that format**
Please provide a link to either [three.js examples page](https://threejs.org/examples/) with the desired loader or any other platform (e.g. npm or github page)

**Additional context**
